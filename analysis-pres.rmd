# Introduction
## Goals for Today
Discuss the analysis from the point of view of our shared scientific goals for
the BEST trial to move pain medicine forward.

Cut through field-specific jargon by focusing on concrete examples of the
elements of precision medicine. Discuss what that term means for everyone in
terms of scientific questions.

### Topics for later discussion
#### Specifics of 12- and 24-week Analyses
The analyses are complementary, not identical analyses with two different
endpoints.

12-week
- Outcomes: PGIC and PEG
- Interventions: Single treatment only

24-week
- Outcomes: PEG only
- Interventions: combination and single treatments, potential sequence effects

#### Future Analyses
- We're reporting the *best* treatment recommendation, but there are likely other
ways to make recommendations that perform similarly.

- Consortium-wide data analyses and data integration.

## Scientific Goals of a Precision Medicine Analysis

- Discover patient characteristics that predict treatment efficacy for each intervention
- Recommend the treatment is best for each participant

These complement each other, on their own knowing what predicts response to a
treatment isn't enough to know which treatment to give a patient, and knowing
what treatment a patient should receive tells you nothing about what predicts
response to treatment.

## Key Elements of a Precision Medicine Analysis
- Discover patient characteristics that predict treatment efficacy for each intervention
- Recommend the treatment is best for each participant
- Estimate the expected benefit from incorporating patient characteristics
- Investigate the treatment recommendations: does the basis for the decision
  make scientific sense? Are there potential health equity concerns with the
  recommendations?



#### Notes and Caveats
1. The following is a general framework and are endpoint agnostic
2. These are all made up numbers

# Overview of a Precision Medicine Analysis
## Discovering Patient Characteristics that Predict Treatment Efficacy
```{r trt_pred, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pred_summary_df <- FakeDataForPredictorSummary()
pubr_pred <- PlotPredPubr(in.data = pred_summary_df)
```

```{r pred_pubr, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
pubr_pred
```

## Recommending Treatments
Answers the question "What intervention would you recommend for this patient?"


Treatment recommendation reasoning should be transparent, scientifically
sensible, and comprehensible to patients and providers.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; align-items: flex-start; width: 100%;">
  <img src="figure/pain-decision-tree.png" alt="Tree" title="This is my image"
  style="flex: 1 1 45%; max-width: 45%; height: auto;"/>
  <img src="figure/integer-model.png" alt="Integer Scores" title="This is my image"
  style="flex: 1 1 45%; max-width: 45%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

## Treatment Recommendations and Dose-finding, an Analogy
Treatment Recommendations from a discovery-focused trial share similarities with
Phase II dose-finding trials where the ways to make recommendations play the
role of dosages:

- Further research is required to corroborate the efficacy of the treatment recommendations
- The results are not binding. The dosage to bring to Phase III can be the result of expert judgment and the
  trial results

Unlike dose-finding studies all of the BEST treatments are already used in
treating cLBP. If personalization significantly reduces PEG compared to the
as-randomized study outcomes it would be perfectly reasonable for early adopters
to test the recommendations in their own practice.



## Benefit of Incorporating Patient Characteristics
Answers the question "What's the benefit of incorporating patient
characteristics into clinical decision making?"

```{r val_comp, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 9, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Call the function with specified treatment policy names
policy_names <- c("Ensemble", "Following\nRecommended\nTreatments", "Personalize\nStage One Only", "Best Single\nTreatment", "As-randomized")
fake_val_data <- FakeDataForValueComparison(policy_names,
                                            point_estimates = c(.65, .6, .475, .4, .3),
                                            ci_half_widths = c(.15, .15, .15, .15, .1))

fake_val_min_comp <- fake_val_data %>%
    filter(TreatmentPolicy %in% c("Following\nRecommended\nTreatments", "As-randomized"))
val_plot_min <- PlotValueComparison(in.data = fake_val_min_comp) +
    ylab("Treatment Approach")

ThemePlot(val_plot_min)
```

The confidence interval must account for the flexibility we have in estimating
and selecting the way we will make the treatment recommendations.


## Characteristics of the Treatment Recommendations
Answers the question "What would following the treatment recommendations look
like in practice?" or "Who do the people who are recommended an intervention
look like?"

```{r results='asis'}
# Create the data frame
data <- tibble(
    `Treatment Strategy` =
        c("Study Assignments", "Example Guideline One", "Example Guideline Two"),
    Duloxetine = c("25%", "30%", "40%"),
    ACT = c("25%", "70%", "10%"),
    EBEM = c("25%", "0%", "40%"),
    ESC = c("25%", "0%", "10%"),
    Maintain = c("10%", "15%", "30%"),
    Augment = c("40%", "70%", "45%"),
    Switch = c("50%", "15%", "25%")
)

# Generate the table with enhanced aesthetic styling
knitr::kable(data, "html", align = 'c', table.attr = "style='width:90%;'") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), # Using Bootstrap for responsive design
    full_width = F, font_size = 24
  )
```

## Proportion of Assigned Treatments - Trial Design Rule
```{r dtr_assignments, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#
dtr_assignments <- FakeDataForDTRAssignments()

PlotDTRAssignments(dtr_assignments)
```


## Proportion of Assigned Treatments Under Example Recommendations
```{r dtr_assignments_complex, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#
dtr_assignments <- FakeDataForDTRAssignments(stage1_trt_probs = c(0.6, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1),
                                             act_action_probs = c(0.6, 0.1, 0.3),
                                             dulox_action_probs = c(0.1, 0.8, 0.1),
                                             ebem_action_probs = c(0.1, 0.4, 0.5),
                                             esc_action_probs = c(0.2, 0.8, 0))

PlotDTRAssignments(dtr_assignments)

dtr_assignments <- FakeDataForDTRAssignments(stage1_trt_probs = c(0.6, 0, 0, 0.4),
                                             act_action_probs = c(0.6, 0.4, 0),
                                             dulox_action_probs = c(0.1, 0.8, 0.1),
                                             ebem_action_probs = c(0.1, 0.4, 0.5),
                                             esc_action_probs = c(0.5, 0.5, 0))

PlotDTRAssignments(dtr_assignments)
```

## Outcome Differences for Important Patient Characteristics

```{r}
dtr_data <- tibble(
  subgroup = c("Overall", "Age <=65 yr", "Age > 65", "Years cLBP >5", "Years cLBP <=5",
               "Anxiety +", "Anxiety -"), # ... continue for all subgroups
  value = c(1, 1.1, 0.6, 0.7, 1.2, 1.3, 0.65),
  method = 'Personalized Treatments'
) %>%
  mutate(subgroup = factor(subgroup,
                           levels = rev(c("Overall", subgroup[which(subgroup != 'Overall')]))))

trial_average_data <- tibble(
  subgroup = c("Overall", "Age <=65 yr", "Age > 65", "Years cLBP >5", "Years cLBP <=5",
               "Anxiety +", "Anxiety -"), # ... continue for all subgroups
  value = c(0.85, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 0.72, 1, 0.8),
  method = 'Trial Average'
) %>%
  mutate(subgroup = factor(subgroup,
                           levels = rev(c("Overall", subgroup[which(subgroup != 'Overall')]))))


pdat <- bind_rows(dtr_data, trial_average_data)

segments_data <- pdat %>%
    pivot_wider(id_cols = subgroup,names_from = method,
                values_from = value) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    mutate(
      diff = personalized_treatments - trial_average,
      color = ifelse(diff > 0, "Positive", "Negative")
    )

PlotSubgroupForest(value_data = pdat, segments_data = segments_data) +
    ylab("Patient Characteristic")

```

## Representative Patient Journeys
Can communicate with representative patient journeys
which represent commonly encountered patient archetypes. See the treatments
they're recommended, why, and the expected PEG.

Can be data-driven or clinician-suggested.
